### 5️⃣ Testing & Validation

- **Unit tests** for Node.js API and Python worker job functions.
- **Integration tests**: simulate job submission → video generation using dummy assets.
- **Performance benchmarks**: record time, VRAM, and FPS metrics via Prometheus.
- **User acceptance**: visually inspect sample outputs for fidelity and lip-sync alignment.

### 6️⃣ Deployment & Maintenance

- **Deployment target**: Docker Compose on any host.
- **Update policy**: pinned versions; quarterly dependency upgrades.
- **Backup strategy**: periodic MinIO snapshots; Postgres dump every 24 h.
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards for GPU utilization, API latency, and job duration.

## 📙 Narrative Roadmap

### **Phase 0 — Foundations**

The journey begins by standing up the infrastructure backbone. Docker Compose orchestrates all containers; Traefik routes internal domains; Prometheus and Grafana provide the first metrics. The goal is a healthy baseline: every service reachable, metrics visible, and GPU exporter verified.

### **Phase 1 — The Scaffold**

With the skeleton network alive, attention shifts to developer ergonomics. The Node backend and Next.js frontend come online, exposing minimal endpoints for file upload and job submission. WebSockets enable live updates, ensuring the first tangible sense of flow between UI and backend. Even at this stage, the system “breathes.”

### **Phase 2 — Breathing GPU Life**

~~Now the GPU worker awakens. The Python service hooks into Redis and starts executing stub tasks. By the end of this phase, training and TTS mock jobs run successfully, Prometheus records durations, and job retry logic works. The stack transforms from concept to kinetic system.~~

🟢 **Revised:** The GPU worker is now powered by **LangGraph.py** for defining task DAGs and **Dramatiq** for execution. It connects to the Node.js **LangGraph.js** layer via **Redis Streams and Pub/Sub**, bridging orchestration between frontend workflows and GPU workloads. By the end of this phase, dummy LoRA and TTS tasks run successfully, report progress through Redis, and metrics flow to Prometheus and Grafana.

### **Phase 3 — Intelligence Layer**

LangGraph orchestrates creativity: Ollama generates narrative and stage descriptions; ComfyUI and the Python worker render them into moving, speaking avatars. Iterative tuning of node graphs and prompt templates refines realism. This is where technical artistry meets AI craftsmanship.

### **Phase 4 — Polishing the Output**

The clips are coherent but raw. ESRGAN upscaling sharpens visuals, audio normalization improves voice quality, and fine-grained logging emerges in Grafana. Error handling and retries become invisible yet vital. The platform begins to feel dependable—ready for repeated creative use.

### **Phase 5 — The Finish Line**

Security and polish take center stage. Authentication, detailed documentation, and one-command deployment make the project ready for open release. Dashboards display everything from GPU load to job throughput, encapsulating a full-stack showcase of local AI orchestration.

## 🎯 Outcome

At completion, the system will be reproducible from scratch, deployable on any single-GPU workstation, and documented to the standard of an internal technical whitepaper. Its modular phases mirror real-world AI integration lifecycles, providing both a production-quality tool and a reference architecture for future self-hosted AI media systems.

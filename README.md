# 🌀 MySpinBot

> _“Blurring the line of truth... Responsibly?...”_

Welcome to **MySpinBot**, the open-source, containerized platform for generating short personalized AI videos of talking “bots” — the kind that spin their way through voice cloning, LoRA training, and lip-syncing, all while making an effort not to melt your GPU.

Think of it as a creative factory where:

- You upload one or more images and a short audio voice clip along with some reference text,
- You prompt a local llm for creating a proper narrative and even a scene description,
- Then it creates the character and a setting[^1] for a portrait image, trains a voice clone and optionally a mini-LoRA[^1],
- And finally it stitches everything together by generating a staged, narrated, lip-synced video

All this **locally**, **privately**, and **under your control**.

[^1]: Still in TODOs. Current version supports uploading an existing portrait image instead of prompting for character creation or LoRA training.

I took this on, after watching Computerphile’s [_MikeBot3000: Can We Build an AI Mike from Open Source Tools?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP8xpkvs_UI) some months ago and used all the help I could get out of my trusty old pals **ChatGPT-5** and **Gemini 2.5** to make it spin — figuratively, literally, and sometimes uncontrollably.

My motivation was initially **educational** but also I needed a facility in my home lab to act as an AI workbench. That is to enable me do things like: examine the inner workings of complex AI pipelines at the code level, testing new models that keeps popping up, especially in the **ComfyUI** ecosystem and in the domain of **Computer Vision**, and also play around with local agents. At the same time I also wanted the ability to quickly produce end-to-end prototypes (thus the frontend layer of the platform).

Hence, I developed a fully local platform which brings many open source components together into a unified AI infrastructure that one can freely use without the need to resolve to paid services. Extra details along with a more thoroughly-written (that is AI-generated 😎) project description can be found [here](docs/01_project_description.md)[^2].

[^2]: At this point, I'd like to stress that... I genuinely, with my own eyes and keyboard, reviewed and edited ...most of the documentation/code that the AI produced.

## 🎥 So, not just another video generation pipeline

If you start digging into the project, you will find that this platform is not just a mere video generation automation, but a reference AI infrastructure deployment and the foundation for things like:
 - Defining/orchestrating local agents
 - Analysing and optimizing existing models and pipelines
 - Prototyping/researching models and workflows
 - and much more

For example one of my focus points for building this, was to get in position to develop and test **CUDA/PyCUDA** optimizations over existing **PyTorch** workflows.

## 🕸️ How much distributed can you get? 

*MySpinBot's* [Dual-plane orchestration layer](docs/phase2/dual_orchestration.md) makes it a platform which supports distributed processing, which in combination to the use of **LangGraph** and [Common Data Schemas](docs/phase2/shared_schemas.md) is able to manage, publish and execute heterogeneous workflows, i.e. workflows which contain tasks to be executed by **Node.js** and **Python** processes (targeting both CPU an GPU execution). At the same time it provides the means to (own-managed or external) llm agents, to plan and compile such workflows, by having its backend components advertise their capabilities via well defined services manifests[^3].

[^3]: Some more work to be done there, foundational components are all laid out though.

## 🥜 System Architecture In a nutshell

> _“Deep breath...”_

The [architecture](docs/02_architecture_overview.md) features a **React UI** and a **Node.js orchestration layer**, which manages **LangGraph distributed workflows** across both **Node.js and Python runtimes**. The backend integrates **specialized AI facilities**, including **ComfyUI diffusion pipelines** and **Ollama-hosted local LLMs**. High-intensity machine learning tasks—such as LoRA training, Text-to-Speech (TTS), and lip-syncing—are handled by **Python-based workers managed via Dramatiq**[^4]. To ensure production-grade reliability, the entire ecosystem is supported by a full observability suite using **Prometheus and Grafana**. To ensure robustness the orchestration layer is build on-top of **Redis** and is backed by a **PostGreSQL persistence layer**. The latter can act also as a **vector database** for facilitating components like **RAG** in the future. Furthermore, to management input/output and staged data the system contains its own **MinIO object storage**. Finally it all comes together via a **Traefix proxy** which manages routing and publishes underlying infrastructure's services endpoints.

[^4]: Dramatiq to be introduced, right now Python tasks are managed by the running process and not by actors.

## 📚 Documentation

The full set of project documents lives in [`/docs`](./docs) — it explains everything from [_why this madness exists_](docs/01_project_description.md) to [_how it will be contained_](docs/04_modular_breakdown.md).

It is best though to start [here](./docs/README.md).

## 🚀 Quick Start

There are basically **four** things you need to take care in order to set this beast up and running. First you need to **make sure your system covers the prerequisites**. Then, you **clone the repo** locally. After that, you need to **execute the provision script** according to your platform (Linux, Windows). Finally, you must **use compose to start the infrastructure**. Thats it!

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Docker with Compose
   - A beefy system with at least 64 GB RAM and lots of cores for the containers.
   - An Nvidia GPU with at least 16 GB of VRAM.
   - NVIDIA drivers + NVIDIA Container Toolkit
   - Local DNS or hostname setup so `*.myspinbot.local` resolves to your Docker host


   For reference the project has been developed and tested on a system with:

   - Windows 11
   - Docker Desktop >v4.55
   - 96 GB RAM
   - RTX 5070 Ti 16 GB VRAM
   - Core Ultra 9 285K (24 Cores)

2. **Clone this repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ktzevani/myspinbot.git
   ```

3. **Run provisioning script**

   `cd` into the newly downloaded workspace and based on you OS run one of the below replacing the passed parameters with the ones you desire. 

   **Linux:**

   ```bash
   AUTH_USER=myuser AUTH_PASS=SuperSecret DOMAIN=myspinbot.local DB_NAME=myspinbot ./scripts/provision_secrets.sh
   ```

   **Windows (Powershell):**

   ```powershell
   $env:AUTH_USER = "myuser"
   $env:AUTH_PASS = "SuperSecret"
   $env:DOMAIN    = "myspinbot.local"
   $env:DB_NAME    = "myspinbot"
   .\scripts\provision_secrets.ps1
   ```

   More information is found [here](docs/phase0/provision_scripts.md)

4. **Start MySpinBot infrastructure (Production)**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

🎉 Your local MySpinBot instance should start spinning!

### 💡 **There are a couple important things to be aware**

> Upon invoking the infrastructure docker images need to be pulled locally and also MySpinBot-specific custom images (backend, frontend, worker, sidecars etc.) need to be built locally. This will take some time, especially the comfyui/worker custom image. So you need to be patient... 

> Upon the initialization of the infrastructure and after the docker images are pulled/built in local registry, the **downloader** sidecar will kick in and try to fetch more than **60GB** worth of data. That is all [required models](docs/03_tech_stack.md#-ai-models-used). So you need to be very patient...

> During the first invocation of the video generation pipeline, things might be a bit slower than usual due to the fact that additional downloads are going to occur.

> As all internal dashboards are accessed through local subdomains, you must configure your DNS resolution process (e.g. `/etc/hosts` on Linux/macOS, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows, or if you are running your custom DNS server you must configure it accordingly) so that these hostnames resolve to the proper IP of the docker host running the MySpinBot stack — typically `127.0.0.1` when running locally.
>
> Example of **hosts** file in Windows:
>
> ```
> 127.0.0.1 api.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 proxy.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 grafana.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 prometheus.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 ui.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 redis.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 s3.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 pgadmin.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 openwebui.myspinbot.local
> 127.0.0.1 comfyui.myspinbot.local
> ```
>
> Without proper hostname resolution, Traefik routing and TLS certificate validation will fail.

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

- **Local-First.** No data leaves your machine.
- **Metrics-First.** Every container speaks Prometheus.
- **Open-Source.** Every dependency is transparent and replaceable.
- **GPU-Aware.** Jobs are serialized to protect your VRAM’s dignity.
- **Humor-Tolerant.** Because debugging diffusion pipelines without sarcasm is impossible.
